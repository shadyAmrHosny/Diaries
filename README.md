# Diaries
Diaries is a backend project that aims to create a RESTful API-driven application similar to Twitter, focusing on core functionalities such as posting, user management, and comments. As a backend developer, this project provides a solid foundation for building the server-side components of a social media-like platform.

Features
-RESTful APIs: Implement RESTful APIs following best practices to create, read, update, and delete posts. Users can share their thoughts, ideas, or any content they wish to share with others using a standardized API interface.

-User APIs: Develop APIs for user management, including user registration, authentication, and updating user profiles. Users can sign up, log in, and personalize their profiles using RESTful endpoints.

-Comments: Enable users to interact with posts by commenting on them. Users can express their opinions, provide feedback, or engage in discussions using RESTful API endpoints.

-MVC Architecture: Structure the project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainable code. Models represent the data and business logic, views handle the presentation layer, and controllers handle the request/response flow.

-Scalability: Design and implement the project with scalability in mind. The architecture should support a growing number of users and posts while maintaining performance and reliability.

Technologies Used
-Node.js: Utilize the popular JavaScript runtime environment for building the server-side logic and APIs.

-Express.js: Leverage the Express.js framework to handle routing, middleware, and provide a robust foundation for building RESTful APIs.

-MongoDB: Employ MongoDB as the database to store user data, posts, and comments.

-Mongoose: Use Mongoose as an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a structured approach to modeling application data and interacting with the database.
